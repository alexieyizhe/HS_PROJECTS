### About
A text-based Pokemon battle game! Face off against gym trainers in arena style combat. It features saving and loading game states, customizable Pokemon, and high score tracking. Created as an ICS4U project.

### Retrospective
This was my first major project in an object-oriented programming language (Java), so it was a great introduction but at the same time very tough to grasp. I was pretty proud of going a bit above and beyond to implement high score tracking and continue learning outside of class.
