# Kanye Quest

Kanye Quest is a top down shooter inspired 99% by the pun and 1% by the eccentric hip hop artist. This is a game built in Java with the graphics2d library. It was created for the ICS4U final project in June of 2017.

### Features
* A wide range of weapons (pistols, rocket launchers, bows, etc - even a flamethrower!)
* Different enemy types (with *pretty rough* pathfinding)
* Handcrafted map (with more levels coming later!)
* Minimap
* Heads-Up Display
* and more to explore in the game!

### Play The Game
 You can download the working code from this repository, compile, and then run it. However, it would be easier to just [download the .jar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l6z3uMQ0IDWnTo545ZNIatyYWwAP4mRX/view?usp=sharing) from Google Drive and run it (note: requires Java Runtime Environment installed).
