### About
Twotris was a 2-player variation of the classic Tetris game, developed as a final project for ICS3U. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the 100% completed polished version while archiving my high school projects, so the Github version remains playable, but not representative of the final game that I was able to built :/

### Retrospective
I don't remember a lot from when I was creating this, but I was very proud of the finished project that I ended up presenting to my teacher (part of it was the main menu falling blocks). I do distinctively remember that getting each individual Tetris block to be interactive went through a lot of refactoring until I finally settled on a grid system with templated blocks.
