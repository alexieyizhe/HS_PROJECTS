### About

Kanye West goes on a (kanye) quest to be the (kanye) best.

Kanye Quest is a top down shooter inspired 99% by the pun and 1% by the eccentric hip hop artist. This is a game built in Java with the graphics2d library, with completely custom maps and graphic assets. It was created for the ICS4U final project in June of 2017, by Alex Xie and Prushoth Vivekanantha.

### Play The Game
 You can download the working code from this repository, compile, and then run it. However, it would be easier to just [download the .jar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l6z3uMQ0IDWnTo545ZNIatyYWwAP4mRX/view?usp=sharing) from Google Drive and run it (note: requires Java Runtime Environment installed).

### Retrospective
I spent way too long placing each individual item on the first map of the game. I think that Prushoth and I did a really good job of focusing on each of our strengths, like splitting up the heavy mathematical stuff (bullet vectors, pathfinding) or designing the map.

We also had a lot of fun coming up with weird, but awesome ideas for the game. I'm really grateful to my grade twelve CS teacher, Mr. McKenzie, for allowing us to have a lot of freedom with the projects that we were to create for our cumulative final projects. It also introduced me to how engaging and interesting it was to work as part of a team.
